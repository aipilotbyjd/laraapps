# üöÄ n8n Clone - Complete Workflow Execution Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of how to properly run workflows in your n8n clone application, covering the complete flow from authentication to execution and monitoring.

## üîê Authentication Flow

### 1. Register a New User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_confirmation": "password123"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "subscription_level": "free",
    "created_at": "2025-10-08T17:00:00.000000Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-08T17:00:00.000000Z"
  },
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_at": "2025-10-08T18:00:00.000000Z"
}
```

### 2. Login (Alternative to Registration)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

### 3. Store Access Token
Save the `access_token` for subsequent API requests:
```bash
ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token-here"
```

## üèóÔ∏è Workflow Creation Flow

### 1. Create a Simple HTTP Request Workflow
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/workflows \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Sample HTTP Request Workflow",
    "description": "A workflow that makes HTTP requests",
    "active": true,
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "name": "Webhook Trigger",
        "type": "webhook_trigger",
        "parameters": {
          "method": "POST"
        },
        "position": {"x": 100, "y": 100}
      },
      {
        "id": "2",
        "name": "HTTP Request",
        "type": "http_request",
        "parameters": {
          "method": "GET",
          "url": "https://httpbin.org/get",
          "headers": [],
          "authentication": "none"
        },
        "position": {"x": 300, "y": 100}
      }
    ],
    "connections": [
      {
        "source": "1",
        "target": "2",
        "sourceOutput": "main",
        "targetInput": "main"
      }
    ],
    "settings": {
      "saveExecutionProgress": true,
      "saveManualExecutions": true
    }
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sample HTTP Request Workflow",
    "description": "A workflow that makes HTTP requests",
    "active": true,
    "nodes": [...],
    "connections": [...],
    "settings": {...},
    "user_id": 1,
    "created_at": "2025-10-08T17:00:00.000000Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-08T17:00:00.000000Z"
  }
}
```

### 2. Store Workflow ID
```bash
WORKFLOW_ID=1
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Workflow Execution Flow

      "message": "Hello from manual execution!",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-08T17:00:00Z"
    }
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "execution_id": 1,
  "status": "running"
}
```

### 2. Store Execution ID

## üîí Subscription-Based Permissions

### Available Subscription Levels:
1. **Free** - Basic workflow automation (5 workflows, 100 executions/month)
2. **Pro** - Advanced features (50 workflows, 1000 executions/month)
3. **Enterprise** - Unlimited everything + team collaboration

### Permission Checks:
- Users can only access workflows they own
- Subscription limits enforce workflow and execution quotas
- Advanced features are locked behind appropriate subscription levels

## üéØ Best Practices

### 1. Error Handling
Always check HTTP status codes:
- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `401` - Unauthorized (check token)
- `403` - Forbidden (check permissions)
- `404` - Not found
- `422` - Validation errors
- `500` - Server errors

### 2. Workflow Design
- Use descriptive names for nodes
- Add proper error handling in workflows
- Test workflows with sample data before production use
- Use version control for important workflow changes

### 3. Security
- Never expose API tokens in client-side code
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate all input data

### 4. Performance
- Monitor execution statistics
- Optimize workflows with too many nodes
- Use appropriate timeouts for HTTP requests
- Cache frequently accessed data

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure access token is valid and not expired
   - Check that `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header is included

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Verify user owns the workflow
   - Check subscription level limits
   - Ensure user has appropriate role/permissions

3. **Workflow Execution Failures**
   - Check execution logs for error details
   - Verify all required nodes are properly configured
   - Ensure credentials are valid if used

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement exponential backoff for repeated requests
   - Monitor API usage against subscription limits

## üìû Support Channels

For issues not covered in this guide:
1. Check application logs in `storage/logs/`
2. Review API documentation in `docs/api/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
3. Use Postman collection in `docs/tools/n8n-clone-postman-collection.json`
4. Contact system administrator for permission-related issues
